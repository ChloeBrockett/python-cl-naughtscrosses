This is a quick command line python app I built to demonstrate knowledge of implementation of algorithms, as well as an example of my coding skills and code quality.
Noughts and Crosses is a solved game and a perfect player will always atleast force a draw. The minimax algorithm is a commonly used recursive tree search algorithm. I used pseudocode from the wikipedia page as a reference

Future extensions of this project would be to include alpha beta pruning, or to convert it to OOP
